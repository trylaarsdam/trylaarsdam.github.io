Hi, I'm Todd Rylaarsdam, a software developer focused on the Internet of Things.

I'm currently a senior at George Fox University studying computer science with a focus on digital electronics, and this summer I'm working at Microsoft as a Software Engieering Intern working on Excel.

Last summer I also worked with the Excel team at Microsoft to significantly reduce forced workbook reloads when editing workbooks
with other users by implementing client-side merge conflict resolution.

I've also worked with Mayo Clinic's Bioengineering Neurophysiology and Engineering Lab (BNEL), where I [created and deployed for patient use an embedded device capable of running seizure detection algorithms in real time](/projects/mayo-summer-2023), and I am continuing to work with Mayo as a contractor.

You can find me and my work on [GitHub (@trylaarsdam)](https://github.com/trylaarsdam/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trylaarsdam/), and [Google Developers (@rylaarsdam)](https://g.dev/rylaarsdam).
